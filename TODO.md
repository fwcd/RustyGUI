# TODO

* General
    * Add `lib.rs` and move the current `main.rs` to a test
* Graphics
    * Ovals
    * Images
* GUI
    * Update GUI only when needed (not always at 60 FPS)
        * preferably only re-render the sections that are needed
    * Sliders
    * Drag lock (remember the widget the mouse clicked on when dragging)
    * Image widgets
